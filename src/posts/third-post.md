This week Adam and I have continued working on my gulp blog. We used gulp tasks to set up the structure and layout of the blog. We used Front Matter to assign dates, titles, and permalinks to each individual blog post. We also used Front Matter to change the file name of each post to reflect the Front Matter title.
