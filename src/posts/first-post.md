My name is Aaron Warman and I'm currently a student learning how to code through the [Devschool](http://www.devschoolrocks.io) online coding bootcamp. I came to Devschool with very little coding experience but after some self study and spending hours upon hours researching every online coding bootcamp imaginable I decided Devschool was the right fit<!--fold-->. After speaking with the owner Jim O'Kelly I knew I would be getting a much more personal education than what the big name bootcamps had to offer. Its a very re-assuring feeling learning from somebody who has decades of experience and not somebody who graduated from the same program the year before. Though I have only been in the program a short time, I would already highly recommend it to anybody looking for a personalized education and not looking to become another assembly line programming drone.
