### Introduction
My name is Aaron Warman and I'm currently a student learning how to code through the [Devschool](http://www.devschoolrocks.io) online coding bootcamp. I came to Devschool with very little coding experience but after some self study and spending hours upon hours researching every online coding bootcamp imaginable I decided Devschool was the right fit. After speaking with the owner Jim O'Kelly I knew I would be getting a much more personal education than what the big name bootcamps had to offer. Its a very re-assuring feeling learning from somebody who has decades of experience and not somebody who graduated from the same program the year before. Though I have only been in the program a short time, I would already highly recommend it to anybody looking for a personalized education and not looking to become another assembly line programming drone.

### Weeks 1-2
I am 2 weeks into the program and I can already tell that I made the right decision. The 1 on 1 paired programming sessions all get recorded to your system so you can watch them as many times as you want. I find this extremely helpful because after each session I can go back and break down everything we went over piece by piece. Our main focus has been Javascript but we have also covered many other topics such as Git, Gulp, Bootstrap, and Sass. Every lesson comes with hours of homework so I never find myself without something to do. Creating this blog was our first project and I'm excited to continue working on it.
