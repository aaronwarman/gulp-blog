I am 2 weeks into the program and I can already tell that I made the right decision. The 1 on 1 paired programming sessions all get recorded to your system so you can watch them as many times as you want. I find this extremely helpful because after each session I can go back and break down everything we went over piece by piece. Our main focus has been Javascript but we have also covered many other topics such as Git, Gulp, Bootstrap, and Sass. Every lesson comes with hours of homework so I never find myself without something to do. Creating this blog was our first project and I'm excited to continue working on it.
