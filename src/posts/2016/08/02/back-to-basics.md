So I decided to take a step back and re-learn some of the basics. I've been using [CodeSchool](http://www.codeschool.com) and [Team Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com). 

Codeschool is a little more animated but they have a lot of good courses. I especially liked the tutorial on Git I would highly recommend it.

Lately I've been doing the Full Stack Javascript track on Team Treehouse. It's convienent because everything is in one place and you get a better feel of coding in an editor and how it relates to the browser and browser console which I feel codeschool doesn't do a great job of doing. If you're looking for some extra tutorials for bascially any aspect of coding definitely check them out.
