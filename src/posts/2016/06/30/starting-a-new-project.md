Today Adam and I spoke about starting a new project building a web application from scratch. The idea I came up with was an application where you could enter in all of your favorite sports teams and the application will tell you all of the game information for that current day.

I am a big sports fan and I always have to check multiple apps on my phone to see when, where and who my teams are playing. I figured it would be nice to be able to have all of that information in one place. The first task I had was to find the API's for each sports event schedules. Easiliy enough ESPN has the Score & Schedules API for the MLB, NBA, and NFL. Finding one for the NHL was a little more difficult, especially for free but I think I found one. Tomorrow Adam and I will use this information to start the project.
