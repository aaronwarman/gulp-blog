The idea I came up with was an application where you could enter in all of your favorite sports teams and the application will tell you all of the game information for that current day.</p>
<p>I am a big sports fan and I always have to check multiple apps on my phone to see when, where and who my teams are playing. I figured it would be nice to be able to have all of that information in one place. The first task I had was to find the API&#39;s for each sports event schedules. Easiliy enough ESPN has the Score &amp; Schedules API for the MLB, NBA, and NFL. Finding one for the NHL was a little more difficult, especially for free but I think I found one. Tomorrow Adam and I will use this information to start the project. </p>

We used gulp tasks to set up the structure and layout of the blog. We used Front Matter to assign dates, titles, and permalinks to each individual blog post. We also used Front Matter to change the file name of each post to reflect the Front Matter title.  </p>

The 1 on 1 paired programming sessions all get recorded to your system so you can watch them as many times as you want. I find this extremely helpful because after each session I can go back and break down everything we went over piece by piece. Our main focus has been Javascript but we have also covered many other topics such as Git, Gulp, Bootstrap, and Sass. Every lesson comes with hours of homework so I never find myself without something to do. Creating this blog was our first project and I&#39;m excited to continue working on it. </p>
